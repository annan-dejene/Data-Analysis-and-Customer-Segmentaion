# Data-Analysis-and-Customer-Segmentaion
I used dataset from a KPMG Virtual Internship program at Insidesherpa to do the following things.
Performed Data Cleaning and Data Augmentation on customer data. Calculated RFM score for each customers and grouped customers based on their RFM score. And finally performed K-Means Clustering and used PCA to visualize the clusters in 2D and 3D.
